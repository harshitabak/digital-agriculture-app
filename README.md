### Key points
- Need to develop an app that offers common functionality for digital agriculture apps (such as 
OAuth-based Single Sign-On, properties, seasons, field records, etc). The API is built on HTTP and is 
mostly RESTful: It has predictable resource URLs, returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors. It 
also accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body
